 * Could negative integers be palindromes? (ie, -1) NO
 * <p>
 * If you are thinking of converting the integer to string, note the restriction of using extra space.
 * <p>
 * You could also try reversing an integer. However, if you have solved the problem "Reverse Integer", you know that the reversed integer might overflow. How would you handle such case?
 * <p>
 * There is a more generic way of solving this problem.
